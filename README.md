We see very clear population clusters, with the first two PCs separating the African populations and Asian populations; and clustering the European and American populations together. Therefore, the American and European ppopulations are more related based on the PCA analysis.

- We see a cluster with populations with African descent, they include: Luhya people of Webuye, Kenya (LWK); Yoruba people of Ibadan, Nigeria (YRI); and African Ancestry in Southwest US (ASW)
- Another cluster representing Asian populations including: Han Chinese people from Beijing, China (CHB); Japanese people of Tokyo, Japan (JPT); Han Chinese South population in China (CHS).
- A larger cluster with majority of European and American populations includes the following: Utah residents with ancestry from Northern and Western Europe (CEU), Colombians from Medell√≠n, Colombia (CLM); Finnish in Finland (FIN); British people from England and Scotland (GBR);  Iberian Populations in Spain (IBS); Mexican Ancestry in Los Angeles, California (MXL); Puerto Rican in Puerto Rico (PUR); Tuscans from Italy (TSI);
